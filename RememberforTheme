Hi im LemonTarrt (Doofusmcgee) and frankly im so sorry that this 
code is nuts. This is just a new hobby for me (ADHD frrr) :3 
---------------------------------------------------------------*/

/*---------------------------------------------------------------
Ive tried to organise and label the code as much as possible so 
that every bit is customisable that said this is super customised
so ill put in some notes on what/how to change things a certain way
so that you can make it your own easily. Just ping me in zuzumis 
if u have any questions or notice any issues and Ill do my best 
to help/solve it.

Note: Any elements structure like ".xxx, .yyyy" Can be separated 
into new lines to customise the elements colour.

Different plugins that you have enables may need to be manually
CSS'd, The ones I have enabled and should be included in this code
are: 

Always animate, AnonymiseFileNames, BetterSettings, 
BiggerStreamPreview, CallTimer, ClearURLs, CrashHandler,
DontRoundMyTimestamps, EmoteCloner, FakeNitro, FakeProfile, 
FakeProfileThemes, FixYoutubeEmbeds, GifPaste, IgnoreActivities,
ImageZoom, MemberCount, MentionAvatar, MoreKaomoji, Oneko (cannot
recolour), petpet, PinDms, ReadAllNotificationsButton, 
RelationshipNotifier, RoleColorEverywhere, StickerPaste, 
TypingIndicator, VencordToolbox, WhoReacted and YoutubeAdblock.

Its fairly easy to code small changes in css as long as you
can find the element name using the inspect tool (ctrl+Shift+I).
Just copy the format as you see in this code and if u have
trouble just @ me :3

There are still some root values that wont update across all facets
so ive been bashing my head in figuring out how to keep this code
"simple" but effective. The asnwer is yes :]
If you can live wiht some text being greyish - awesome!, If not
youll need to locate the individual element name and adjust the
colour. I may tidy and finish it all up/figure out a way how 
to root it properly but until then this will do.
